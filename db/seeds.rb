This is primarily rice field hunting, with some fields in beans this year. There are 4 pit blinds to hunt that will all be available. There is an available guide service upon request, but only for the first 3 days (not available December 23). Unfortunately, we will not be able to split this into individual days, so it's 4 days or bust! Contact Will Petty below for more information!", address: "774 State HWY 306, Parkin, AR 72373", availability: "December 20-23, 2021", price: "1200"}
