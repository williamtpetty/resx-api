As a child, Rinella devoured stories of the American wilderness, especially the exploits of his hero, Daniel Boone. He began fishing at the age of three and shot his first squirrel at eight and his first deer at thirteen. He chose the colleges he went to by their proximity to good hunting ground, and he experimented with living solely off wild meat. As an adult, he feeds his family from the food he hunts. Meat Eater chronicles Rinella’s lifelong relationship with nature and hunting through the lens of ten hunts, beginning when he was an aspiring mountain man at age ten and ending as a thirty-seven-year-old Brooklyn father who hunts in the remotest corners of North America. He tells of having a struggling career as a fur trapper just as fur prices were falling; of a dalliance with catch-and-release steelhead fishing; of canoeing in the Missouri Breaks in search of mule deer just as the Missouri River was freezing up one November; and of hunting the elusive Dall sheep in the glaciated mountains of Alaska. Through each story, Rinella grapples with themes such as the role of the hunter in shaping America, the vanishing frontier, the ethics of killing, the allure of hunting trophies, the responsibilities that human predators have to their prey, and the disappearance of the hunter himself as Americans lose their connection with the way their food finds its way to their tables. Hunting, he argues, is intimately connected with our humanity; assuming responsibility for acquiring the meat that we eat, rather than entrusting it to proxy executioners, processors, packagers, and distributors, is one of the most respectful and exhilarating things a meat eater can do.", image_url: "https://media-exp3.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQEBlIp8wdwylA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1516933372200?e=1631750400&v=beta&t=wpFEdTrs5UNE_jocP_NTU5dE7oLcEr_YtXok_KImc-E", zip_code: Faker::Address.zip_code, host: true},

Phil’s is the remarkable story of one man who followed his faith in God and soon after invented a duck call that would begin an incredible journey to the life he had always dreamed of for himself and his family. In the love of his country, his family, and his maker, Phil has finally found the ingredients to the good life he always wanted. In Happy, Happy, Happy, you’ll go beyond the scenes of Duck Dynasty and learn about Phil’s colorful past and the wild road to the blessed life he leads today. Before, Phil’s passion for the outdoors led him down some shady paths, and as a young proprietor of a rough bar, he says, he lived a life of “romping, stomping, and ripping.” But through it all, Phil felt he was a “called” man—called to live off the land, called to leave a career in football for duck hunting, called to create a new kind of duck call, and finally, called to follow God and lead a life of faith.", image_url: "https://st2.depositphotos.com/4049585/5840/i/600/depositphotos_58401867-stock-photo-conversation-between-two-hunters.jpg", zip_code: Faker::Address.zip_code, host: true},

Now, he returns to share his philosophy on life, which can be summed up in five short words. Love God, love your neighbor. In this inspirational and entertaining book, you will learn what makes Phil Robertson tick. Robertson shares his views on faith—and how it has totally changed his way of life and how he treats others; family—how he raised his kids and is raising grandkids while teaching them the life principles he lives by; ducks—and the business principles that started the Duck Commander empire; marriage—including what he’s learned from his own marriage; and of course, his opinions on controversial topics like gun control, taxes, prayer in school, and the government. UnPHILtered is the ultimate guide to everything Phil Robertson believes in. Balancing his sometimes off-the-wall comments with his strong focus on home and family life, it is sure to spark discussion, laughs, and a sincere appreciation for Phil’s unique approach to life.", image_url: "https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/hunters-hunting-equipment-going-away-through-rural-field-towards-at-picture-id1061434830?k=6&m=1061434830&s=612x612&w=0&h=lTQty2uPVp1Hi8d4fIkAlrJJhYRED4I3187a4W_3BKs=", zip_code: Faker::Address.zip_code, host: true},
